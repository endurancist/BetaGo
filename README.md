# BetaGo

## Description

BetaGo is a computer program that plays gomoku. It utilizes an evaluation function to calculate a score for each vacuum space, and it always chooses the space with highest score as its next move. Now it plays at the level of my friends and I (which is probably not very strong) and we can only occasionally win it.

Currently there's a bug in our algorithm that makes it make illogical decision when near the boundaries of the board.
